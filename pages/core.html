            <p class="date">Updated on 17th February, 2019</p>
            <p>
                Some time ago, I was put in a situation where most of who I am was challenged. Several events unfolded,
                and I was drawn into the entire mess. There was one common attribute which belonged to all of them, the
                deepening of sentiment.<br><br>

                Most of us are put in situations where we tend to get attached. Sentiment is an inevitable outcome of
                attachment. This emotional idealism is strongly felt and it has the power to grow with time, based on
                how you let it affect you. But what most people do not realize early on is the absolute pain which is
                caused to themselves when things don’t go as planned. Acting on sentiment is something which people
                find hard to reason out. Logic doesn’t exist there, it’s just one of the strongest personal feelings
                ever. Even when things are looking horrible, they continue to act in an odd way which is likely to only
                provide the satisfaction for the foundation of their sentiment.<br><br>

                Even when things are going downhill for us, we are unable to even realize that we aren’t taking the
                right approach. We stay in the endless loop that we made for ourselves and find hard to leave. We
                become less flexible to alternative opinions, more biased to older conventions, whilst losing our power
                of reasoning.<br><br>

                <img class="centre_image rel_pos" src="../assets/heart.jpg" alt="heart picture"><br><br>

                There is one thing which we must not fail to realize. Each and every one of us has a certain build, a
                CORE. It constitutes everything which we would say defines ourselves. Our values, our principles, our
                image, our dreams and aspirations, and so much more all of which aren’t meant to be transient based on
                the passing of emotions or sentiment. Whatever happens, these things must not change because that would
                be a cardinal sin. It is the basis for everything we stand for and it would be absolutely unacceptable
                to lose that especially since it would be happening without our control.<br><br>

                It isn’t easy to contain the strength to find this core again, or even to let it from not slipping
                away. It is the one mindset which you need to enforce in your mind, leaving it absolutely
                non-negotiable. Once you understand that you need to keep this intact, your approach to dealing with
                situations becomes refined with a certain cynicism which is required for your own betterment. No matter
                what the situation, no matter how deep the sentiment, you cannot act in a manner that puts your core at
                stake. On this matter, the one who takes the side of sentiment belongs to the losing side. You must
                always care about this. My dad always said, “When you fall, it's better to get up and dust yourself
                rather than rolling on the spot and getting yourself dirty”.<br><br>

                I too understood the power of this, it helped me shape everything I am now. This write up is addressed
                to all those who find themselves in a situation where they cannot understand what’s important, either
                themselves or their sentiment. Don’t lose yourself, it just isn’t worth it.
