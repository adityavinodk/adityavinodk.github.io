            <p class="date">Written on 17th February, 2019</p>
            <p>
                Some time ago, I was put in a situation where most of who I am was challenged. Several events unfolded,
                some as expected, some completely surprising. But there was one common attribute which belonged to all
                of them, the deepening of sentiment.<br><br>

                Most of us are put in situations where we tend to get attached. Sentiment is an inevitable outcome of
                attachment. This emotional idealism is very strongly felt and it has the power to grow if we wish to
                let it. But what most people do not realize early on is the absolute pain which is caused to themselves
                when things don’t go as planned. Acting on sentiment is something which people find hard to reason out.
                Logic doesn’t exist there, it’s just one of the strongest personal feelings ever. Even when things are
                looking bad, they continue to act in a rather odd way which is maybe only providing the satisfaction of
                doing something for the foundation of their sentiment.<br><br>

                Even when things are clearly not fine with us, sometimes we are unable to even realize that we are not
                on the right approach. We stay in the endless loop that we made for ourselves and find hard to leave.
                We become less flexible to alternative opinions, more biased to older conventions, lose our power of
                reasoning.<br><br>

                But there is one thing which we must always realize. Each and every one of us has a certain build, a
                CORE. It constitutes everything which we would say defines ourselves. Our values, our principles, our
                image, our dreams and aspirations, and so much more all of which aren’t meant to be transient. Whatever
                happens, these things must not change because that would be a cardinal sin. It is the basis for
                everything we stand for and it would be absolutely unacceptable to lose that especially since it would
                be happening without our control.<br><br>

                It just isn’t easy to contain the strength to find this core again, or even to let it from not slipping
                away. But it is the one single mindset which you need to enforce in your mind, it is absolutely
                non-negotiable. Once you understand that you need to keep this intact, your approach to dealing with
                situations becomes refined with a certain cynicism which is required for your own betterment. No matter
                what the situation, no matter how deep the sentiment, you cannot act in a manner that puts your core at
                stake. On this matter, the one who takes the side of sentiment is the one who belongs to the losing
                side. You must care, you must always care about this. My dad always said, “When you fall, it's better
                to get up and dust yourself rather than rolling on the spot and getting yourself dirty”.<br><br>

                I too understood the power of this, it helped me shape everything I am now. This write up is addressed
                to all those who find themselves in a situation where they cannot understand what’s important, either
                themselves or their sentiment. Don’t lose yourself, it just isn’t worth it.
