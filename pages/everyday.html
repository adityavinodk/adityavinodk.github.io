            <p class="date">Written on 3rd May, 2019</p>
            <p>
                Wake up. It’s a new day today. New experiences, new sights to see, new people to meet, new places to go
                to, new activities, new feelings altogether. Today will be exciting and fun. <br><br>

                But what if that isn’t the case? What if each day feels the same. Did you have to wake up to live the
                previous day? Questioning yourself every day ‘What’s in it for me?’. Worse enough, what if it felt
                transactional? You get only if you give. You have to give sacrifice some of your time, your space, your
                moments, only for you to get back some joy, some feel-good factor of your own - life can feel very
                transactional. <br><br>

                What could be the reason for feeling this way? Maybe that’s where the issue lies, this irreplaceable
                dependency on external factors other than yourself to make you feel better. That could be natural, that
                could be something which you have had for a very long time, but don’t have anymore. The feeling of not
                having something just for yourself that brings you joy can be rather deserting. <br><br>

                But the point I am trying to draw out here is about maturity, and constancy of behavior, something that
                I see a lot in our parents’ generation. They have unsatisfying, unfulfilling days as well, but their
                daily work, thoughts, and behavior don’t change as much according to the dull times. They don’t slack
                off. So how are they able to do it? <br><br>

                I could draw it down to 2 reasons. Firstly, their focus is shifted from their mental dissatisfaction to
                large responsibilities like work, family, goals, etc. At that age, your responsibilities would be so
                large that you naturally become finely tuned in such a way - to give prioritize those duties
                irrespective of the changing times. But secondly and more importantly, they build themselves, live life
                more excitingly which turns out to be a method to compensate for the dull times. That’s right! They find
                their own joy. <br><br>

                It isn’t simple, it just isn’t. First discovering what changes you can bring into your life, and
                secondly understanding if that would bring you joy. Anything you do must always provide 3 factors - it
                must be a sensible thing to do, it must bring you joy, it should have a positive impact on you. That is
                what we all must aspire to bring naturally into our lives, changes that satisfy these 3 necessary traits
                at all times. <br><br>

                There is a reason why it's always better to be self-aware. An easy way out of anything would be to run
                away from all this dissatisfaction, crumble the sensation inside, ignorant to the truth that it would
                strike you over and over again. But no. We have the power of dealing with issues, we have the power to
                bring about change in our own lives and it would be futile not to use it. Just never be careless about
                it, ever. <br><br>

                It’s time for bringing about positive change in our own lives. I feel it now more than ever.
